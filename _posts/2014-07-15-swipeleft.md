I inserted drone strike "kill decision" imagery into the popular Tinder mobile dating app, forcing users to vote yes or no on the simulated fate of a subject.

After researching the process via which drone strike kill decisions are made, I became interested in exploring the role of computer mediated UI in the reduction of complex judgements to simple binary decisions  -- Tinder was an ideal platform juxtaposing this, as it's success as a dating app is largely based on it's ability to use interface to transform an inherently complex decision (finding a potential romantic partner) into a simplistic game that feels like it has no consequences.

As a bonus, the Tinder UI *required* users make a yes-or-no decision before they could move on, forcing them to participate in my situationist experiment without the ability to opt-out.
