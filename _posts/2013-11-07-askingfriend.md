What do people want to know, but not want others to know they want to know?

When people want to ask something embarrassing in a public forum, they often end their statement with the phrase "asking for a friend."  This trope has become clich√© to the point that it's almost certainly always used in self-parody.

_Asking Friend_ is a Twitter bot that finds tweets that match that speech pattern, and then anonymizes and reposts them.
